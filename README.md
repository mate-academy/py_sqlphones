# py_sqlphones

For py_phones (https://github.com/mate-academy/py_phones) create a new sqlcontacts module.
In this module, you must provide the ability to work with data in a SQLite database.
main.py should be left unchanged, except for importing and creating the class.   


To deploy project on your local machine create new virtual environment and execute this command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run all style checkers and tests use commands:

`pytest `

`flake8 .`

`pylint pylint sqlcontacts main`

`mypy --ignore-missing-imports .`
